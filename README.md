## SEASALT
# Super Easy Algorithm for Saving And Loading Text
A C++ Demo Program for Saving and loading

this repository is mostly a backup for myself but feel free to use it in whatever way you want, SEASALT works by using the [fstream C++ Library](https://cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/fstream/) to read and write an external .txt file. It saves information from a Class Object and writes a file called person.txt (this name can be changed to whatever you want). It saves, loads and displays through a `cin` input for testing.

Feel free to reach out to my email if you have any questions mailto:ilikegoldfishys@gmail.com
